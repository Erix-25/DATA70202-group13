Why's Sanju Samson captain of RR ?,ArchEnxiD,0,50,https://i.redd.it/4laq0f8ts4pc1.jpeg,"So why's Sanju Samson captain of Rajasthan Royals? Haven't seen any captaincy masterclass from him , doesn't contribute much with the bat (those quick fire 30s it may be crucial for the team but no one cares about it ) doesn't bring a large number of fans, he's no where near the Indian T20i setup. So why's he still the captain it's not like RR doesn't have anyone else who can take up the captaincy role , they literally have the White ball captain of England, champion of previous T20 wc.
Is he the captain just cuz he's with the team since 2013 and has good relations with team management?

Ps - I'm not hating on Sanju, he's decent guy. Just wanna know what do you guys think about it "

First Fan Poster for Sanju Samson (2013).. More in the description,vishvicenta1,63,5,https://i.redd.it/qjh3h02fm6pe1.jpeg,"I'm from Hyderabad and having grown up as a Huge Dravid fanatic, I moved teams to Rajasthan Royals after 2011. I can never forget that auction. RCB inner circles were telling the reason Dravid wasn't retained is due to the price and they'll definitely buy him in the auction. So, when the auction started I was hoping for that. Ganguly came before Dravid and he was unsold. When dravid came, there was a 20 second delay where no one bidded and the auctioneer almost asked for a last call for the bid. I went close to the TV in disbelief and then a bid. It was Rajasthan. That day I made my mind no matter what happens, I'll always support and be loyal to the RR franchise for saving us from the insult of being unsold. When Warnie retired and they made RD as captain, my loyality to the RR management grew even more. Note that this was the time RD wasn't getting his due. He was dropped from the ODI team and people and people believed that he was a bad captain. But, once Dravid was bought by RR everything changed. He had a fabulous 2011 series in England where he was called up to the ODI and T20 team as well when he retired from white ball cricket and he took the underdog RR team to the Champions League final as a captain. Great memories. When Dravid was in DD during the years RR was suspended, I tried to watch a few games but never felt like it was my team. That's when I knew that RR was my team forever. 

Coming to this pic, this was the 2013 season. SRH vs RR in Hyderabad. I was blown away by what this 18 year old named Sanju Samson did in the previous games. He came out of nowhere, didn't look as muscular but was hitting the ball as clean on par with the best strikers in the game. So, got this little message board which read, ""Well done Sanju Samson. At 18, I was playing video games"". Sunny Ji on commentary joked that's the reason you're in the stands watching the game and Sanju is on the field playing it. Whenever Sanju does well, it feels so good man. I'm so happy that he finally got his breakthrough in T20 Internationals as well. 

I attended the 2022 SRH vs RR game in Hyderabad too where I took a Sanju for World cup poster. He scored a 50 that game and don't think they showed it on TV due to probable controversy. I also fought the police that day who didn't want the crowd to stay back for the presentation ceremony.  Long story lol. 

Anyways, just felt like sharing my story of this poster before the season began. Excited for this season. Even though we may not have the best team on paper, we always find a way and it suits us being the underdogs. Do or Die. HALLA BOL

P.S. If anyone here is an RR insider, It'd be so cool if you can show this to Sanju/RD. Also, would love to be in a meet & greet if such a thing is there.  Been a long time dream to meet either of them. (I guess I can dream üòÉ )"

1) Sanju Samson (C) (wk) 

2) Yashasvi Jaiswal

3) Nitish Rana

4) Riyan Parag

5) Dhruv Jurel (wk)

6) Shimron Hetmeyer ‚úàÔ∏è

7) Wanindu Hasranga ‚úàÔ∏è

8) Jofra Archer ‚úàÔ∏è

9) Tushar Deshpande

10) Mahesh Theekshana ‚úàÔ∏è

11) Akash Madhwal

12) Sandeep Sharma



Batting might feel a bit short. But that's necessary for our top 6 to play responsibly till the end. Although, Hasarnaga and Jofra can tonk sixes. And Deshpande has scored a century for Mumbai in domestics. 

Tushar, Jofra and Theekshana bowl 2 overs each in powerplay. Jaipur pitch will aid Jofra and Theekshana, I feel. 

If we manage to keep the opposition under 50 in powerplay (in Jaipur), we would have done a great job. Then, we can build on it by using Hasaranga and try to bowl Madhwal as much as possible. If they give a 2-2 overs spell, Theekshana can be brought again for 1 over. Hasaranga can continue to bowl if he is bowling well. Theekshana should have 1 over left for the 17th over. 

Sandeep can start bowling once the spinners stop from one end. Jofra's quota should be completed before the 17th over, or make him bowl just 3 overs then. Sandeep completes his quota as our main death bowler, supported by Madhwal, Theekshana (for one over) and Deshpande. 


To do well, in this season, we have to win all our Jaipur games. Guwahati isn't actually reliable and it would be an irony to call it a ""home game"". 

We should make full use of the conditions in Chepauk and Lucknow. If we eke out two wins there and win atleast 4 in Jaipur, we would have 6 wins. We would need just 2 wins more to qualify. 


What do you think? Is this the playing 12 you had in mind for RR? Or are there differences in opinions?"

RAJASTHAN ROYALS GONNA WIN IPL 2025 !,PotentialUsual7720,0,17,https://i.redd.it/ffgih170xdme1.jpeg,"The Rajasthan Royals (RR) clinched their first and only Indian Premier League (IPL) title in the inaugural 2008 season under the leadership of the late Shane Warne. Since then, they've experienced fluctuating performances, with a notable resurgence in recent years, including a runner-up finish in 2022 and a playoff appearance in 2024.

Squad Overview for IPL 2025:

For the 2025 season, RR has retained a strong core and made strategic acquisitions to bolster their lineup:

Batsmen:

Sanju Samson (Captain & Wicketkeeper): Leading from the front, Samson amassed 531 runs in the previous season, averaging 48 with a strike rate of 153.

Yashasvi Jaiswal: The young opener has been in stellar form, recently scoring 391 runs in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, including a match-winning 161.

Riyan Parag: After facing criticism in earlier seasons, Parag had a breakout year, accumulating 573 runs at an average of 52 and a strike rate of 149.

Shimron Hetmyer: Known for his explosive batting, Hetmyer has consistently delivered quick runs, maintaining a strike rate of 153 over six IPL seasons.

Nitish Rana: A versatile batsman, Rana's inclusion adds depth and flexibility to the batting order.


All-rounders:

Wanindu Hasaranga: Renowned for his leg-spin, Hasaranga also boasts a T20 batting strike rate of 145, making him a valuable asset at No.7.


Bowlers:

Jofra Archer: Returning to RR, Archer's pace and precision make him a formidable leader of the bowling attack.

Maheesh Theekshana: The mystery spinner adds variety to the bowling lineup.

Sandeep Sharma and Tushar Deshpande: Both bring experience and reliability to the pace department.



Strengths:

Balanced Batting Lineup: With a mix of aggressive and anchoring batsmen, RR's top seven is both dynamic and resilient.

Bowling Depth: The combination of Archer's pace and the spin duo of Hasaranga and Theekshana offers versatility across different pitch conditions.


Challenges:

Lack of Explosiveness: While stability is a strength, the absence of players like Jos Buttler might reduce the team's firepower in crucial matches.

Bench Strength: Concerns have been raised about the depth beyond the primary XI, which could be a factor during long tournaments.


Predictions for IPL 2025:

Betting odds suggest that while RR is a strong contender, teams like Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings are currently favored to win the title. RR's odds stand at 10.00, indicating a competitive but challenging path to the trophy. 

Conclusion:

The Rajasthan Royals have assembled a promising squad for IPL 2025, blending experienced internationals with emerging talents. Their success will hinge on consistent performances, strategic gameplay, and the ability to adapt to evolving match situations. While they face stiff competition, RR's potential to clinch their second IPL title cannot be underestimated.

RRs seemingly weaker squad 2025,Practical_Recover_98,24,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/RajasthanRoyals/comments/1hc9qoj/rrs_seemingly_weaker_squad_2025/,"Ever since auction of 2025 there has been a lot of talk about how RR is the weakest squad among all teams currently. I agree the current squad may not be as lethal as last cycle but it was almost impossible to retain or regain those players. So just thought of comparing RR seemingly weaker squad with one of the best first playing 11 of IPL next year. 

If you do man to man comparison for first 11 + impact player with Mumbai Indians: 

1. R Sharma / Y Jaiswal
2. W Jacks / S Samson
3. S Yadav / N Rana
4. T Varma / R Parag
5. N Dhir / D Jurel
6. H Pandya / S Hetmyer
7. R Minz / S Dubey
8. D Chahar / T Deshpande 
9. M Santner / W Hasaranga
10. J Bumrah / S Sharma
11. T Boult / J Archer
12. A Gazhalfar. / M Theekshana 

Based on the current form and performances, you can see 
- Jaiswal is in better form than Rohit in T20Is. But you can never rule out R Sharma. 
- Sanju is doing similar or better performance than W Jacks. 
- S Yadav is definitely more explosive and impactful than N Rana. 
- R Parag and T Varma both do similar roles for their side and are similar in capabilities. Only difference is Tilak showed it in international matches as well but Riyan didn‚Äôt get that opportunity. 
- There is no replacement to H Pandya in world cricket. 
- D Jurel for now seems better than N Dhir. 
- S Dubey is performing better than R Minz in domestic. 
- Last year Deshpande did better than D Chahar for CSK. 
- Hasaranga is more versatile for T20Is than Santner. 
- Inspite of return from injury at his best Archer can deliver what Boult can at his current age. 
- M Theekshana is as good as Gazhalfar. RR can also play F Faruqui on seeming conditions. 
- J Bumrah is world‚Äôs best T20 bowler but stats wise S Sharma is close to JB. 

All in all if you see, 
MI beat RR with : Sky, Hardik, Bumrah
RR beat MI with : Hasaranga, Dubey, Jurel and impact player. 
They tie with : T Varma and R Parag, R Sharma and Y Jaiswal, S Samson and W Jacks, D Chahar and T Deshpande, Archer and Boult. 

If I take current form, then I would say Jaiswal, Sanju, Deshpande beat their MI counterparts. And rest all tie. 

Now RR squad doesn‚Äôt seem that bad right?? Just wanted to share my view on our underrated squad for next year. All we need is everyone sticking to their role and doing their best. Halla bol !!!

From Sanga to Dravid,Bruce_wayne_now,27,24,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gzrnan,"What a huge letdown this transition brought.

RR management was infamous of their auction startergies until Sangakara came in picture.

Before the IPL 2022 mega auction, the team retained Sanju Samson, Jos Buttler, and Yashasvi Jaiswal to create a foundation for future success.

During the 2022 auction, they secured impactful players like Trent Boult, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Shimron Hetmyer, all of whom contributed to a strong season.

The Rajasthan Royals finished as runners-up, marking their best performance since their title-winning campaign in 2008. Players like Jos Buttler (Orange Cap winner for most runs) and Yuzvendra Chahal (Purple Cap winner for most wickets) played pivotal roles. And we successfully sold these match winners for paying up core of Sanju, Jaiswal, Parag, Jurel & Hetmeyer.

Sanju, Jaiswal seemed too good for retentions, but so do Boult, Chahal & Butler. Hetmeyer is not world class finisher, he can‚Äôt do it always, and a possible injury of Hetmeyer sums up our season with lack of finishers."

Qualified for playoffs-

1)Nitish rana(UP) Batting: 7-1-105-17.50-120.66----Poor, only a couple of good innings. Need to get in form          as he has an important role to fill.

Bowling: 7-12-3-5.91---Good, did his role of a part-time spinner well, was really economical with a few handy wkts.

2)Shubham dubey(Vidar) 3-1-91-45.50-165.45---Great, finished the matches well. Can really make a difference as an impact player.

3)Kumar Kartikeya(MP) 7-28-15-7.10---Joint Highest wickets with lower economy, thus can be called the best bowler of group stage. Really positive news for RR, provides depth in spin bowling.

4)Sandeep(Chd) 6-23.4-9-7.09---Was economical inspite of bowling death overs, much like what he does for RR. A good sign as RR would bank on Sandeep for death bowling.

Eliminated-

1)Sanju Samson(ker, Capt.) 5-0-136-27.20-149.45---Hot and cold, needs to improve the consistency. Expectations are really high after the recent India performances.

Bowling: 7-24.3-7-7.22----Good, was economical with consistent wkts.

Showed great allround abilities. A good sign for RR as he can fill the role of an allrounder if the team requires.

3)Akash Madhwal(Ukhnd,Capt.) 5-16.5-8-8.73---Bagged constant wkts. but needs to be much more economical. Not much of a worry as yudhvir has shown much promise and can be our impact bowler if akash doesn't perform."

This is in my opinian is what we should go with as we have 12 overs in spin with kumar  , riyan and hasaranga with 12  overs of pace and even 16 on faster tracks  bowling first with increasing more of Sanju's options in batting first as now either 12 overs of spin +riyan or 16 overs of pace with 2 int. fast bowler and variety of sandeep and tushar deshpande.

Now i belive we should step out with even if things go downhill and we need a extra batter we can use our impact player right away and still be left with plenty of variety in bowling

What‚Äôs been the secret behind our formidable fast-bowling lineup? Was it simply buying the best pacers at astronomical prices? While we did bring in some renowned names, that wasn‚Äôt the main factor in our success. The real magic lies in how we‚Äôve tactically and technically developed these players, especially bowlers.

We didn‚Äôt create Avesh, but after a rough 2023 season with LSG and struggles with the national team, we gave him a platform to regain his spot in the XI. He emerged as a more refined death bowler, better than his previous self. (2024 Auction Price: ‚Çπ9.75 Cr)

**Yuzi Chahal**
A key bowler for India, disregarded by RCB, joined RR and had the season of his life‚Äîwinning the Purple Cap. It‚Äôs underappreciated how Sanju Samson and the management turned him into a reliable death bowler, maximizing his potential. This was a masterclass in utilizing top-tier talent. (Auction Price: ‚Çπ18 Cr)

**R. Ashwin**
Once labeled as a Test specialist who didn‚Äôt fit modern T20 cricket, Ashwin at RR became a dual-threat. Thanks to expert bowler coaching and management at Royals, he rediscovered his lost all-rounder abilities, even earning a spot back in India‚Äôs T20 World Cup squad. (Auction Price: ‚Çπ9.75 Cr)

**Prasidh Krishna**
Known for his high economy rate despite being crucial to KKR‚Äôs 2021 finals run, Prasidh joined RR and evolved further. He bowled the most dot balls in IPL 2022, showcasing immense improvement. (Auction Price: ‚Çπ9.50 Cr)

**Trent Boult**
Boult had already proven himself with MI, delivering several memorable performances during their title-winning campaigns. However, at RR, despite aging, he continued to deliver top performances‚Äîparticularly with the ball in the powerplay, maintaining his pace and consistency. (Auction Price: ‚Çπ12.5 Cr)

**Sandeep Sharma**
Sandeep was always a solid bowler, but many would agree that his full potential was unlocked at Royals. He reminded fans of his stellar 2017 season with Sehwag‚Äôs PBKS, rejuvenating his career at RR.


The list doesn‚Äôt stop here. Players like Nandre Burger, Kuldeep Sen, Kartik Tyagi, Chetan Sakariya, and Obed McCoy have all benefitted from RR‚Äôs system.

Lastly, the improvement in these players is clearly reflected in their recent auction prices. Almost all of them have gone for significantly higher sums, showing how their value has skyrocketed under RR‚Äôs management. It‚Äôs a testament to the franchise‚Äôs ability to nurture and maximize talent.


We arguably had one of the best quick-bowling units in the previous IPL cycle, and I believe we‚Äôve only strengthened it since last year. (I know you may not be convinced yet, but let me explain.)

A well-rounded bowling attack is one that‚Äôs balanced‚Äîhaving specialist bowlers for the powerplay, middle overs, and death. I think we've made significant improvements to the overall balance of our bowling unit.

**Tushar Deshpande**

Tushar has been a standout performer, finishing as the leading wicket-taker for CSK in their title-winning season. He picked up 21 wickets in IPL 2023 and has continued his form into 2024 with 17 wickets. His consistency and ability to deliver in pressure situations, particularly with the ball in the death overs, make him a vital asset to any team. With RR‚Äôs coaching and nurturing system, Deshpande has the potential to evolve into a key bowler for us in the upcoming seasons.

**Aakash Madhwal**

Aakash Madhwal had an impressive IPL 2023 with MI, and while he had a dip in form in 2024 (a case similar to Avesh Khan‚Äîbrilliant in one season, struggling in another) he remains a bowler with immense potential. Madhwal was a crucial part of MI‚Äôs success in 2023, helping them reach the playoffs alongside Bumrah. I think with the right guidance and development, he could become one of our standout bowlers.

Both Deshpande and Madhwal have all the tools to become our next Avesh Khan and Prasidh Krishna. Given how RR‚Äôs management and coaching system nurture bowlers, it wouldn't be surprising if we see both of them rise to greater heights in the coming seasons.

**Jofra Archer**

Jofra comes with a bit of risk, especially concerning his fitness, but there‚Äôs also immense reward potential if he performs. Archer did well in the recent ENG vs WI T20 series, where he played three games and was in good touch: 4-0-31-1, 4-0-25-1, and 2-0-16-0. While it‚Äôs risky, if he performs as he has in the past, he could become one of the best bargains of the auction. It‚Äôs high risk, high reward. Given that the management has shown faith in him despite his fitness concerns, I believe it wouldn‚Äôt be irrational to trust both the management and the player.

**Wanindu Hasaranga**

Hasaranga came very close to snatching the Purple Cap from Yuzi in 2022, and he was the highest wicket-taker in the 2021 T20 World Cup in Dubai. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he regains that Purple Cap this season with RR.

**Maheesh Theekshana**

A like-for-like replacement for Ashwin in terms of bowling, but at a much cheaper cost. While he‚Äôs not a heavy wicket-taker, his economy in the past three IPL seasons has been impressive: 7.20 (2024), 8.00 (2023), and 7.45 (2022). In terms of wickets, he has taken 2 in 5 matches, 11 in 13, and 12 in 9, respectively.

**Fazal Haq Farooqi**

A huge steal! The left-arm quick can swing the ball both ways at pace, and he could be an ideal replacement for Trent Boult. Depending on the conditions, we could rotate him with Theekshana.

**Kwena Maphaka**

Maphaka is a left-arm medium-fast bowler who will likely be developed more than a regular starter. If all goes well with his development, we could see him starting by 2027. At just 18 years old, he was the leading wicket-taker for South Africa's U-19 team, but it‚Äôs still too early to make firm predictions.

Additionally, the management has handled the high-risk signing of Jofra Archer quite well by also acquiring 4-5 quality fast bowlers. While it would certainly be a blow if Jofra doesn‚Äôt live up to expectations due to injury, the addition of Farooqi, Madhwal, and Maphaka makes that scenario less likely. While it‚Äôs not a 0% risk, these purchases have significantly minimized it. The depth of quality fast bowlers ensures that RR won‚Äôt be left exposed, no matter what happens with Archer.

**Tailender batting** 

Honestly, it wouldn‚Äôt have made much sense for us to go back and buy the same old bowlers, especially since they went for crazy prices at the auction. The smarter move was to bring in young, hungry players with a lot of potential and give them the chance to develop under our coaching. This not only saves money but sets us up for the future.

On top of that, we‚Äôve now got bowlers who can actually bat, something we were missing last year. Jofra Archer isn‚Äôt just about pace‚Äîhe can smash a few sixes when needed. Ashwin‚Äôs batting was used really well last season, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll handle Hasaranga in the same way. Tushar Deshpande just went and smashed a hundred in domestic cricket, so he's another player who can contribute with the bat. Plus, we‚Äôve got Nitish Rana and Riyan Parag, who can chip in with a couple of overs on a rough day. Riyan‚Äôs bowling has definitely improved, so we‚Äôre in a much better position this year.

If you look at our 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. it‚Äôs a big step up from last year. Players like Avesh, Sandeep, Chahal, and Boult (to some extent) couldn‚Äôt really do much with the bat in hand. But this season, we‚Äôve got more depth and versatility in the lower order, so we‚Äôre way more confident in handling different match situations.

Back to back ducks for Samson,boy__18__,114,21,https://i.redd.it/dsng6dku7ofd1.png,
Title winners vs Wooden spoon ,Evening_Success_3869,54,13,https://i.redd.it/su4p4p83ms3e1.jpeg,"The squad looks weaker than previous year. But it's not that bad. We are still a strong contender for title. The only issue is a more possibility of finishing last in the table is also lurking around, which was not at all a concern in the previous years. But with an excellent top 3 and a very good bowling line up we can overcome this issues. Sanju, Rana or Jaiswal can stay till the end. 
There is no much confusions regarding the 6 batters in our team. And Archer, Sandeep, Deshpande will also be part of the playing 11/12. So out of 12 , we know who the 9 players are going to be.  Let's look who the next 3 players will be.  I think Hasaranga is sure to play because of his batting abilities. So that's 10 out of 12. 
And we have 3 pace bowlers and 1 spinner in it. 
Now the remaining to will depend on team plans and need of impact sub based on situation. If a batting collapse happens Dubey will likely be the impact sub. KS Rathore is also good choice. Maybe the kid will also get a chance. 

But in an optimum situation, where we don't need Dubey there are two possibilities (while bowling 2nd)

1. 4 pacers + 2 spinners 
a) Here Farooqi will join Archer in the ranks. And as impact sub Karthikeya will join Hasaranga. 
b) Theekshana will join the playing 11 with Hasaranga. And Madhwal will come in as impact sub. 

2. 5 pacers + 1 spinner
If both Rana and Parag assists Hasaranga, Madhwal and Farooqi will join Archer and co.

If we are bowling 1st, usage of impact sub will become a bit more tiresome. 
With the aforementioned 4 bowlers, we will go for Theekshana or Farooqi as 5th bowler. 
So either 3 pacers + 2 spinners (which was what we used to do in the last cycle) or 4 pacers and 1 spinner (we do have 2 part time spinners this time around)"
What is your take on Royals Retentions? I feel Dhurv over Jos(for 14 Cr)can be a mistake but The position Dhruv bats is crucial and hard to get another options in auction,doc69doc,6,23,https://i.redd.it/ncw6fih573yd1.jpeg,Surly RR will go after Buttler in auction if purse allows
I'm having mixed feelings about this squad!,DrDeathRow,15,17,https://i.redd.it/2cl6vteu0h3e1.png,"If you see carefully, there are no players who play for India in all three formats regularly. The foreigner choices are absurd, (barring Hetty who was anyway retained) with two Sri Lankans who aren't that big names, Jofra who hasn't been at his best lately, a young maphaka and not so experienced Fazalhaq. We gave up on Buttler and Boult for this. RR should have given Jofra to MI and bought back Boult as he literally makes the game of 19 overs and 9 wickets after he's done after the first over. It is more worrisome for Jaiswal and Samson that they will have to face Boult and Bumrah attack, so not buying Boult not only weakens our bowling attack but also makes our batting vulnerable atleast against one franchise against which we are known to have close matches. 
I'm happy that TKC is not a part of our team anymore, who I think was the sole villian last year in playoffs. Also happy that Krunal Pandya didn't get into our team because it was the first time I questioned myself to support this team, of which I have been a loyal supporter since their first game, 17 years ago in 2008. 
I'm still hopeful that even if we don't win, we will be able to produce and support unknown talent and provide Team India with future legends on the lines of Jadeja, Yusuf Pathan, Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Samson, Dhruv Jurel etc.

All the best Royals!"
