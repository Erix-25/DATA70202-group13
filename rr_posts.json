        "text": "So why's Sanju Samson captain of Rajasthan Royals? Haven't seen any captaincy masterclass from him , doesn't contribute much with the bat (those quick fire 30s it may be crucial for the team but no one cares about it ) doesn't bring a large number of fans, he's no where near the Indian T20i setup. So why's he still the captain it's not like RR doesn't have anyone else who can take up the captaincy role , they literally have the White ball captain of England, champion of previous T20 wc.\nIs he the captain just cuz he's with the team since 2013 and has good relations with team management?\n\nPs - I'm not hating on Sanju, he's decent guy. Just wanna know what do you guys think about it "

        "text": "Ever since auction of 2025 there has been a lot of talk about how RR is the weakest squad among all teams currently. I agree the current squad may not be as lethal as last cycle but it was almost impossible to retain or regain those players. So just thought of comparing RR seemingly weaker squad with one of the best first playing 11 of IPL next year. \n\nIf you do man to man comparison for first 11 + impact player with Mumbai Indians: \n\n1. R Sharma / Y Jaiswal\n2. W Jacks / S Samson\n3. S Yadav / N Rana\n4. T Varma / R Parag\n5. N Dhir / D Jurel\n6. H Pandya / S Hetmyer\n7. R Minz / S Dubey\n8. D Chahar / T Deshpande \n9. M Santner / W Hasaranga\n10. J Bumrah / S Sharma\n11. T Boult / J Archer\n12. A Gazhalfar. / M Theekshana \n\nBased on the current form and performances, you can see \n- Jaiswal is in better form than Rohit in T20Is. But you can never rule out R Sharma. \n- Sanju is doing similar or better performance than W Jacks. \n- S Yadav is definitely more explosive and impactful than N Rana. \n- R Parag and T Varma both do similar roles for their side and are similar in capabilities. Only difference is Tilak showed it in international matches as well but Riyan didn‚Äôt get that opportunity. \n- There is no replacement to H Pandya in world cricket. \n- D Jurel for now seems better than N Dhir. \n- S Dubey is performing better than R Minz in domestic. \n- Last year Deshpande did better than D Chahar for CSK. \n- Hasaranga is more versatile for T20Is than Santner. \n- Inspite of return from injury at his best Archer can deliver what Boult can at his current age. \n- M Theekshana is as good as Gazhalfar. RR can also play F Faruqui on seeming conditions. \n- J Bumrah is world‚Äôs best T20 bowler but stats wise S Sharma is close to JB. \n\nAll in all if you see, \nMI beat RR with : Sky, Hardik, Bumrah\nRR beat MI with : Hasaranga, Dubey, Jurel and impact player. \nThey tie with : T Varma and R Parag, R Sharma and Y Jaiswal, S Samson and W Jacks, D Chahar and T Deshpande, Archer and Boult. \n\nIf I take current form, then I would say Jaiswal, Sanju, Deshpande beat their MI counterparts. And rest all tie. \n\nNow RR squad doesn‚Äôt seem that bad right?? Just wanted to share my view on our underrated squad for next year. All we need is everyone sticking to their role and doing their best. Halla bol !!!\n\n"

A good sign for RR as he can fill the role of an allrounder if the team requires.\n\n3)Akash Madhwal(Ukhnd,Capt.) 5-16.5-8-8.73---Bagged constant wkts. but needs to be much more economical. Not much of a worry as yudhvir has shown much promise and can be our impact bowler if akash doesn't perform."

        "text": "After reading several reviews claiming that we messed up in the auction and predicting we‚Äôll finish in the 7th or 8th spot this IPL, I think it‚Äôs time to analyze things a bit.\n\nThis will be a long thread, likely spread across 3-4 posts, so stay patient. We won‚Äôt rely heavily on statistics here‚Äîjust a thorough analysis.\n\nThis is the first post of 4 (or maybe 5).\n\nOne of the Most Underappreciated Aspects of the Rajasthan Royals\n\n1) The Recent Evolution of Our Fast-Bowling Unit\n\nWhat‚Äôs been the secret behind our formidable fast-bowling lineup? Was it simply buying the best pacers at astronomical prices? While we did bring in some renowned names, that wasn‚Äôt the main factor in our success. The real magic lies in how we‚Äôve tactically and technically developed these players, especially bowlers.\n\n**This is something that doesn‚Äôt get nearly enough credit: how the Rajasthan Royals nurture and transform bowlers.**\n\n**Avesh Khan**\nWe didn‚Äôt create Avesh, but after a rough 2023 season with LSG and struggles with the national team, we gave him a platform to regain his spot in the XI. He emerged as a more refined death bowler, better than his previous self. (2024 Auction Price: ‚Çπ9.75 Cr)\n\n**Yuzi Chahal**\nA key bowler for India, disregarded by RCB, joined RR and had the season of his life‚Äîwinning the Purple Cap. It‚Äôs underappreciated how Sanju Samson and the management turned him into a reliable death bowler, maximizing his potential. This was a masterclass in utilizing top-tier talent. (Auction Price: ‚Çπ18 Cr)\n\n**R. Ashwin**\nOnce labeled as a Test specialist who didn‚Äôt fit modern T20 cricket, Ashwin at RR became a dual-threat. Thanks to expert bowler coaching and management at Royals, he rediscovered his lost all-rounder abilities, even earning a spot back in India‚Äôs T20 World Cup squad. (Auction Price: ‚Çπ9.75 Cr)\n\n**Prasidh Krishna**\nKnown for his high economy rate despite being crucial to KKR‚Äôs 2021 finals run, Prasidh joined RR and evolved further. He bowled the most dot balls in IPL 2022, showcasing immense improvement. (Auction Price: ‚Çπ9.50 Cr)\n\n**Trent Boult**\nBoult had already proven himself with MI, delivering several memorable performances during their title-winning campaigns. However, at RR, despite aging, he continued to deliver top performances‚Äîparticularly with the ball in the powerplay, maintaining his pace and consistency. (Auction Price: ‚Çπ12.5 Cr)\n\n**Sandeep Sharma**\nSandeep was always a solid bowler, but many would agree that his full potential was unlocked at Royals. He reminded fans of his stellar 2017 season with Sehwag‚Äôs PBKS, rejuvenating his career at RR.\n\n\nThe list doesn‚Äôt stop here. Players like Nandre Burger, Kuldeep Sen, Kartik Tyagi, Chetan Sakariya, and Obed McCoy have all benefitted from RR‚Äôs system.\n\nLastly, the improvement in these players is clearly reflected in their recent auction prices. Almost all of them have gone for significantly higher sums, showing how their value has skyrocketed under RR‚Äôs management. It‚Äôs a testament to the franchise‚Äôs ability to nurture and maximize talent.\n\n\nWe arguably had one of the best quick-bowling units in the previous IPL cycle, and I believe we‚Äôve only strengthened it since last year. (I know you may not be convinced yet, but let me explain.)\n\nA well-rounded bowling attack is one that‚Äôs balanced‚Äîhaving specialist bowlers for the powerplay, middle overs, and death. I think we've made significant improvements to the overall balance of our bowling unit.\n\n**Tushar Deshpande**\n\nTushar has been a standout performer, finishing as the leading wicket-taker for CSK in their title-winning season. He picked up 21 wickets in IPL 2023 and has continued his form into 2024 with 17 wickets. His consistency and ability to deliver in pressure situations, particularly with the ball in the death overs, make him a vital asset to any team. With RR‚Äôs coaching and nurturing system, Deshpande has the potential to evolve into a key bowler for us in the upcoming seasons.\n\n**Aakash Madhwal**\n\nAakash Madhwal had an impressive IPL 2023 with MI, and while he had a dip in form in 2024 (a case similar to Avesh Khan‚Äîbrilliant in one season, struggling in another) he remains a bowler with immense potential. Madhwal was a crucial part of MI‚Äôs success in 2023, helping them reach the playoffs alongside Bumrah. I think with the right guidance and development, he could become one of our standout bowlers.\n\nBoth Deshpande and Madhwal have all the tools to become our next Avesh Khan and Prasidh Krishna. Given how RR‚Äôs management and coaching system nurture bowlers, it wouldn't be surprising if we see both of them rise to greater heights in the coming seasons.\n\n**Jofra Archer**\n\nJofra comes with a bit of risk, especially concerning his fitness, but there‚Äôs also immense reward potential if he performs. Archer did well in the recent ENG vs WI T20 series, where he played three games and was in good touch: 4-0-31-1, 4-0-25-1, and 2-0-16-0. While it‚Äôs risky, if he performs as he has in the past, he could become one of the best bargains of the auction. It‚Äôs high risk, high reward. Given that the management has shown faith in him despite his fitness concerns, I believe it wouldn‚Äôt be irrational to trust both the management and the player.\n\n**Wanindu Hasaranga**\n\nHasaranga came very close to snatching the Purple Cap from Yuzi in 2022, and he was the highest wicket-taker in the 2021 T20 World Cup in Dubai. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he regains that Purple Cap this season with RR.\n\n**Maheesh Theekshana**\n\nA like-for-like replacement for Ashwin in terms of bowling, but at a much cheaper cost. While he‚Äôs not a heavy wicket-taker, his economy in the past three IPL seasons has been impressive: 7.20 (2024), 8.00 (2023), and 7.45 (2022). In terms of wickets, he has taken 2 in 5 matches, 11 in 13, and 12 in 9, respectively.\n\n**Fazal Haq Farooqi**\n\nA huge steal! The left-arm quick can swing the ball both ways at pace, and he could be an ideal replacement for Trent Boult. Depending on the conditions, we could rotate him with Theekshana.\n\n**Kwena Maphaka**\n\nMaphaka is a left-arm medium-fast bowler who will likely be developed more than a regular starter. If all goes well with his development, we could see him starting by 2027. At just 18 years old, he was the leading wicket-taker for South Africa's U-19 team, but it‚Äôs still too early to make firm predictions.\n\nAdditionally, the management has handled the high-risk signing of Jofra Archer quite well by also acquiring 4-5 quality fast bowlers. While it would certainly be a blow if Jofra doesn‚Äôt live up to expectations due to injury, the addition of Farooqi, Madhwal, and Maphaka makes that scenario less likely. While it‚Äôs not a 0% risk, these purchases have significantly minimized it. The depth of quality fast bowlers ensures that RR won‚Äôt be left exposed, no matter what happens with Archer.\n\n**Tailender batting** \n\nHonestly, it wouldn‚Äôt have made much sense for us to go back and buy the same old bowlers, especially since they went for crazy prices at the auction. The smarter move was to bring in young, hungry players with a lot of potential and give them the chance to develop under our coaching. This not only saves money but sets us up for the future.\n\nOn top of that, we‚Äôve now got bowlers who can actually bat, something we were missing last year. Jofra Archer isn‚Äôt just about pace‚Äîhe can smash a few sixes when needed. Ashwin‚Äôs batting was used really well last season, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll handle Hasaranga in the same way. Tushar Deshpande just went and smashed a hundred in domestic cricket, so he's another player who can contribute with the bat. Plus, we‚Äôve got Nitish Rana and Riyan Parag, who can chip in with a couple of overs on a rough day. Riyan‚Äôs bowling has definitely improved, so we‚Äôre in a much better position this year.\n\nIf you look at our 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. it‚Äôs a big step up from last year. Players like Avesh, Sandeep, Chahal, and Boult (to some extent) couldn‚Äôt really do much with the bat in hand. But this season, we‚Äôve got more depth and versatility in the lower order, so we‚Äôre way more confident in handling different match situations.\n\n________\nP.S. (2 days later) - Sorry, folks! Can‚Äôt make continuations of this post due to being short on time. \n"

The only issue is a more possibility of finishing last in the table is also lurking around, which was not at all a concern in the previous years. But with an excellent top 3 and a very good bowling line up we can overcome this issues. Sanju, Rana or Jaiswal can stay till the end. \nThere is no much confusions regarding the 6 batters in our team. And Archer, Sandeep, Deshpande will also be part of the playing 11/12. So out of 12 , we know who the 9 players are going to be.  Let's look who the next 3 players will be.  I think Hasaranga is sure to play because of his batting abilities. So that's 10 out of 12. \nAnd we have 3 pace bowlers and 1 spinner in it. \nNow the remaining to will depend on team plans and need of impact sub based on situation. If a batting collapse happens Dubey will likely be the impact sub. KS Rathore is also good choice. Maybe the kid will also get a chance. \n\nBut in an optimum situation, where we don't need Dubey there are two possibilities (while bowling 2nd)\n\n1. 4 pacers + 2 spinners \na) Here Farooqi will join Archer in the ranks. And as impact sub Karthikeya will join Hasaranga. \nb) Theekshana will join the playing 11 with Hasaranga. And Madhwal will come in as impact sub. \n\n2. 5 pacers + 1 spinner\nIf both Rana and Parag assists Hasaranga, Madhwal and Farooqi will join Archer and co.\n\nIf we are bowling 1st, usage of impact sub will become a bit more tiresome. \nWith the aforementioned 4 bowlers, we will go for Theekshana or Farooqi as 5th bowler. \nSo either 3 pacers + 2 spinners (which was what we used to do in the last cycle) or 4 pacers and 1 spinner (we do have 2 part time spinners this time around)"

        "text": "If you see carefully, there are no players who play for India in all three formats regularly. The foreigner choices are absurd, (barring Hetty who was anyway retained) with two Sri Lankans who aren't that big names, Jofra who hasn't been at his best lately, a young maphaka and not so experienced Fazalhaq. We gave up on Buttler and Boult for this. RR should have given Jofra to MI and bought back Boult as he literally makes the game of 19 overs and 9 wickets after he's done after the first over. It is more worrisome for Jaiswal and Samson that they will have to face Boult and Bumrah attack, so not buying Boult not only weakens our bowling attack but also makes our batting vulnerable atleast against one franchise against which we are known to have close matches. \nI'm happy that TKC is not a part of our team anymore, who I think was the sole villian last year in playoffs. Also happy that Krunal Pandya didn't get into our team because it was the first time I questioned myself to support this team, of which I have been a loyal supporter since their first game, 17 years ago in 2008. \nI'm still hopeful that even if we don't win, we will be able to produce and support unknown talent and provide Team India with future legends on the lines of Jadeja, Yusuf Pathan, Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Samson, Dhruv Jurel etc.\n\nAll the best Royals!"

I would love to see both of them dominate and smash the ball around.\n\n3. Nitish Rana\n4. Riyan Parag\n5.Dhruv Jurel\nA powerful middle order. Rana is an experienced player who can bat at No. 3 and also play the anchor role if required. Parag and Jurel are dependable and will deliver 100%, I am confident about it.\n\n6. Shimron Hetmyer\n7. Wanindu Hasaranga\n8. Jofra Archer\nAll three are capable of hitting the ball hard, providing batting depth up to No. 8, which somewhat addresses last year's issues.\n\n9. Fazalhaq Farooqi\n10. Sandeep Sharma\n11. Tushar Deshpande / Akash Madhwal\nImpact Sub: Shubham Dube / Kumar Kartikeya\n\nI would like to add Maheesh Theekshana to the squad in place of Farooqi, but that might compromise our bowling. Fazalhaq Farooqi is a like-for-like replacement for Trent Boult. Even though he's not as good as Boult, he can swing the ball and is a genuine wicket-taker.\n\nArcher can bowl two overs in the powerplay and two at the death. Sandeep can do a similar job as last year, bowling three overs at the death and one in the powerplay. So, our powerplay and death bowling seem sorted.\n\nHasaranga is in good form and can bowl in the middle overs as a genuine wicket-taker. If Tushar or Akash can support him in the middle overs without conceding too many runs, we have a good chance. Additionally, Parag or Rana can bowl one or two overs in the middle, depending on the conditions.\n\nIf Theekshana is added to the squad, he would provide more wickets, but it would require us to drop Farooqi, which could weaken our powerplay and death bowling.\n\nMistakes in Squad Selection:\nWe should have targeted players like Mohammed Shami, Avesh Khan, Prasidh Krishna, or Deepak Chahar. At the very least, we should have gone for Khaleel Ahmed, who is a reliable powerplay bowler. Budget constraints seem to have limited our options.\n\nBackup Concerns:\nNo backup for the top 4 batters.\nNo overseas batters apart from Hetmyer.\nIf Archer gets injured, our plans could fall apart. This reminds me of the vibes from the 2019-2022 seasons. For us to qualify for the playoffs, our Indian core must perform at 100%.\n\nWhatever happens, I will always remain a loyal Royals fan!\n\nSuggest your 11 here"

Sandeep Sharma\n10. Khaleel Ahmed\n11. Adam Zampa ‚úàÔ∏è \n\nRR is going with the lowest purse so they‚Äôll have to be really smart with their buys. The focus needs to be on a good bowling lineup but they can‚Äôt overspend on a player.\n\nThe biggest task for RR is going to be to replace Chahal. I don‚Äôt think they can get him back with their purse. The other Indian alternatives are Rahul Chahar, Mayank Markande, and Suyash Sharma all of whom are decent but I don‚Äôt think they are anywhere near Chahal. That is why, I would go for an overseas spinner in form of Zampa. I think he is very underrated and he‚Äôll be pretty cheap too.\n\nIn terms of the pace bowling, RR needs an Indian pacer and an overseas one. A good Indian pacer to get would be Khaleel Ahmed. He will not be very cheap but I think he‚Äôll be really good fit for RR. Left arm pacer who specialises in the powerplay will be a like to like replacement for Boult. The overseas pacer I would like RR to go for is Nathan Ellis. He is an extremely underrated death bowler. He started over Rabada for Punjab quite a few times and did really well. I think the trio of Khaleel, Sandeep, and Ellis will be really effective.\n\nThis leaves two spots in the XI. The number 3 spot and the number 7. The whole last cycle, RR struggled with not having all rounders. I don‚Äôt want them to make the same mistake again so I would like them to get proper all-rounders this time around. For number 3, I think they should get Maxwell. Yes he is in the twilight of his career and he didn‚Äôt have the best of seasons last time around but Maxwell is a quality player. I also feel that allowing him to bat at number 3 will give him the right flexibility and comfort. His bowling will be very handy too. The number 7 spot is where lots of players could fit in like Shahbaz, Brar, Kishore, Nishant so RR can get any of them.\n\nI feel this is pretty achievable in 41 CR and that this XI will perform good.\n\nThoughts?"
