1jerzg3,flaneur9777,Wish this was our main Jersey.,5
1jerzg3,ipriyanshk20,LetsgooðŸ”¥,3
1jerzg3,Big-Particular-458,"Yeah, it would have been cool.",2
1jewt3q,Capable-Magician-418,"Supporting and investing in players, that's something i won't even doubt in case of RR. Let him focus on his practice to make a comeback, reels waghera toh banti rahegi.",5
1jewt3q,ipriyanshk20,No need to worry about this thing when you have a certain Dravid in the team.,1

1jepet4,div2starsatredit,nost LSG in a million possibilities!,14
1jepet4,dedupe1,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cod\_x8omzdg&ab\_channel=Beyond23CricketPodcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cod_x8omzdg&ab_channel=Beyond23CricketPodcast)

The full video is here and the predictions are the last sections.

He predicts : KKR, SRH, LSG, RR. I can't believe LSG was so easy for him to pick above RR probably biased towards langer.",9
1jepet4,DesiNPC,Where did he say?,1
1jepet4,GunnerByHeart,"Don't believe anyone who saying LSG will qualify and CSK not. That shows how dumb his analysis is. They just say team names based on their agenda/PR etc.

Their best 12 combination likely as below as per Cricinfo.

Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (c & wk), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Shahbaz Ahmed, Abdul Samad, Akash Singh, Ravi Bishnoi, Akash Deep, Manimaran Siddarth

Tell me if there is any dependable bowler in LSG. even if they score 200-220 opposition will chase it easily.

Also their middle order seems ok-ok only. In Batting they are relying too much on foreign players like Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, David Miller, out of these only Pooran will be consistently successful on their home ground which favors spin. This team will really struggle on spinning pitches.

I don't know RR will qualify or not but for LSG to qualify their top order should have a very outstanding season",1
1jepet4,Kchinki,"Yeah true. On paper great team. But I donâ€™t see Pantâ€™s captaincy, opening pair and the Indian bowlers having a full season without injury at all.",4
1jepet4,Soggy_Ad_3686,"I get your point about LSG, donâ€™t agree with CSK. CSK doesnâ€™t look too good on paper. A pretty ordinary team. Although they always overachieve",3
1jepet4,GunnerByHeart,"CSK looks good for their pitch. Very Balanced.

Ruturaj Gaikwad (c), Rachin Ravindra, Rahul Tripathi, Shivam Dube, Vijay Shankar/Deepak Hooda, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, MS Dhoni (wk), Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha Pathirana, Noor Ahmad/Jamie Overton

look at this bowling lineup Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Matheesha Pathirana, Noor Ahmad/Jamie Overton , Khaleel Ahmed, 

All gun bowler for their pitch Khaleel Ahmed is their 5th and weakest bowler , who could have been 2nd bowler in different teams.

Also they have batting depth due to all rounders. Dhoni coming in at 8/9. if Dhoni performs average and not become liability then they are good enough. Plus they have IPL winning experience.",2
1jevj3v,Big-Particular-458,"They wanted Boult mostly. They knew MI would go to length for Boult. They weren't sure they would get Boult as well as MI had plenty of money. So they went till 12.5 for Jofra.

Basically, they wanted a good pacer. 

Naman Dhir yes, like to like for Rana.

Ashwin Anna - don't know why they went for him till 9 cr. Paise hi nahi the itne. Aa jata to lanka lag jati.

Aise to Arshdeep Buttler and Chahal kr piche bhi bhage the ye log. 
.",1
1jevj3v,ipriyanshk20,"They wanted Naman Dhir, I could sense that 100%
and surely they paid Jurel 14 cr to play up the order and then play Dhir at 5.

I will not be surprised if Rana plays at 5, because Jurelâ€™s best will come in top 3 only.",1
1jevj3v,Capable-Magician-418,"They didn't bid for chahal and it makes sense coz they couldn't as his price went beyond rr's scope when he crossed 8-9 cr., also we had an option to get cheaper foreign spinners.",1
1jevj3v,Only_Sea_3140,"Naman Dhir like to like nhi h rana ka Naman Dhir hota toh Jurel ko no 3 pe push kr dete waha uska best utilisation hota Rana no.5 pe nhi khel sakta

Ashwin wala hum lucky the isliye Bach gye

Arshdeep ka toh bs wo 18cr tak lejana chate the isliye Kiya SRH ne bhi ye hi Kiya tha

Buttler ka 9cr tak keval fans ko khus krne k liye paddle uthaya unko pta tha wo 10 se kam m nhi milega

Chahal k liye toh  paddle hi nhi uthaya ek baar bhi chahal ka toh wo bahut clear the ki nhi chahiye ye",1
1jevj3v,Substantial-Cake-857,"Nah man , Jurel was paid 14 cr because he is a perfect no.5 in T20s. , can play both spin and pace well and also is a good finisher(2023 season)",1
1jevj3v,Big-Particular-458,I'm not sure. They tried the same with Uthappa. He played him at a position he wasn't neant to and had a bad season.,1
1jevj3v,ipriyanshk20,Wese dekha jaaye toh Rana ke best stats number 5 pe hi hai IPL me.,2
1jevj3v,ipriyanshk20,"Not really man, he is such a class act player, its not like he will not do good at 5 but he will be a beast in top 3. 
You ideally want your best bats to play most number of balls. I know it might be Rana only at 3 but Jurel at 3 and KSR at 5 is something a fanboy in me wants.",2
1jevj3v,ipriyanshk20,"The thing is DDP, Uthappa all these players failed even when they were sent to open.

I hope Rana if plays at 3 atleast can give is a 350 run season, anything less than that is wasting the potential that we have on bench.",1
1jevj3v,Only_Sea_3140,Rana ko number 5 pe hi try Krna chahiye nhi chale toh KSR se replace kr dena chahiye iski wajah se Jurel ko underutilize nhi Krna chahiye,2
1jevj3v,Substantial-Cake-857,"Thing is if he plays at 3 , pur lower middle order looks really weak in case of a collapse , if he plays at 5 the top order players will be able to play freely knowing that jurel is yet to come. Also it's about playing a role not playing more balls , for example klaasen also comes at no.5 and is probably the best player in the world",2
1jevj3v,ScreenOtherwise7641,I really thought they would go for tripathi given his performance in playoffs. He also took on ashwin in sf reducing the pressure. He was a steal for csk.,1
1jevj3v,ipriyanshk20,"Wahi bhai, mujhe bas lag raha hai that Dravid has something in store for Jurel this season. 14 CR diya hai to uska utilisation to hoga.

Rana is not a long term project for us anyways, I would rather have KSR our local boy playing at 5 man. But this will happen when Rana eventually fails.",2
1jevj3v,ipriyanshk20,Fair enough,1
1jevj3v,ipriyanshk20,"They wanted someone who can bowl too thats why went for Dhir, Rana and even Krunal",1
1jevj3v,Only_Sea_3140,Dravid ka eye talent glt nhi ho sakta isliye hi mujhe Jurel se itni ummid h bs usko no 3 se hi start krwaye,2
1jevj3v,ScreenOtherwise7641,Did not bid for shahbaz. He is a good batter and performed well for srh with both bat and ball. Not a top order batter though more like ashwin axar types.,1
1jevj3v,ipriyanshk20,"Rarely hi koi player apne debut season ya apne debut game me impact daal paata hai chahe IPL ho ya international. This guy has nerves of steel.

Pehle test series me MOTM as a WK and series saving innings kheli.

Penle IPL game me almost won it for us.",3
1jevirc,abskkr24,"Don't forget Jofra and his golf swing sixes, the guy used to blast those at number 7 (and even at 6 once or twice) for us last time he was in RR!!",5
1jevirc,ipriyanshk20,Ideally this should be the lineup but deshpande will play surely and theekshana might be IP or Sandeep,5
1jevirc,Few_Measurement_5335,"Would have Deshpande in place of Shubham Dubey, would play theekshana in jaipur and chepauk, instead of faruqi. Also Parag and Rana are not IPL level bowlers yet, they might be decent in domestic, but not in ipl. so to count them as bowlers would be a stretch.",0

1jevirc,Bunnyismm,Being honest This time RR not looking dangerous No good bowling younger Middle order indian batsman who can't take pressure its all about Samsun this year Last 3 years were golden for them bcoz they have that kind of combination this year nah,-7

1je52y4,Every-Finish5634,"this auction was a nightmare for royals. released jos,trent,powell and choosing jurel, archer and some other players which i don't think will perform in this ipl. they bought the youngest chap was there any need to buy him. India have many players which have much more strength experience and like himmat singh .I am not an expert but I am sure this time we are not making into playoffs. 
this is the side  looks same to the 20-21 side",1
1je52y4,Innocentvisitor69,He actually did.. If Jaiswal does fire big time we will be on table bottom probably,-1

1je52y4,Capable-Magician-418,"Go and check the matches and his performance, just coz of the hundreds u r forgetting the poor performance of other matches.",5
1je52y4,anonymus_G,I mean he did made us get 4 points and got 359 runs in 11 matches. might have crossed 500 if he played 16 like others.,1
1je52y4,Innocentvisitor69,Thik h bhai dhruv Jurel and parag will take us to finalðŸ¤¡,-3
1je52y4,Capable-Magician-418,"He made most of the runs in the 2 matches and was a liability in the rest of the matches. I have already made posts about it if u can't see that and open ur eyes then there is nothing to say. Even nitish rana wins atleast 2 matches every season he played for kkr. Hetmyer won us many lost matches as well so why are people so interested in letting him go? Our management had only 6 slots to retain and they made the choices which were best for rr, not for just this season but for the complete cycle and for the future of RR. Love buttler like every RR fan should do but stop bringing the team down being stuck in the past.",1
1je52y4,Capable-Magician-418,"Yeah bro and if they take us then don't start praising them doing a flip, negative idiots like u act like experts and then end up lookin like clowns. This management has people who other franchises will give blank checks to have so at least be a decent supporter and trust them for one season, if we fail then start what ever crying u all keep doing",5
1je52y4,Batboix3107,Very true butler had a huge impact in our 2022 RR campaign but was a huge flop in the successive two seasons also his availability issues cost us two playoffs glad we didnâ€™t go for a single English batsman this season,3
1je52y4,Only-Pound4276,Jofra England ka hi hai bhai.. jab koi english liya ni toh jofra bhi mast MI ko chipka dete 13 cr me. unke paas boulty jitna budget hi na bachta..,1
1je52y4,Batboix3107,I said English batsman ! Also With the kind of form jofra is in he will probably be dropped from the 11 after 2-3 games lol,0
