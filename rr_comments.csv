1iq0k24,Connect-Barracuda-66,They will never let el classico on first match(RR VS PBKS) coz then watcher expectations will sky rocket and not all matches can deliver it and everyone will get bored.(Sarcasm),68
1iq0k24,Retro_Gamer12521,I was so angry in 2023 when Chennai went on to play the first match against Gujarat. Like it has always been the finalists and then they went on to do this.,38
1iq0k24,Beautiful-Speaker-60,I am hoping for good times ahead with yashasvi and parag becoming future superstars of india and will attract more visibility and fans for RR along with RR winning some more trophies. We will eventually get our due respect.,16
1iq0k24,Capable-Magician-418,"We didn't get playoff matches coz SMS is too small but once Anil Agarwal stadium is complete that problem till go away.

Teams with popularity generally get the opening matches, RR is not very popular now but wait till Yashasvi becomes the superstar that he is predicted to become and the fans will follow. Also with the strong indian core we are building the trophy is just one lucky season away which will also boost popularity.

We had shit owners who made RR the inaugural champions turn into a franchise with very less relevance but that has been changing since 2021 with badale taking good decisions.(Thank heavens that bastard kundra was ousted from RR)

Also, about the fans giving up on this season, those are mainly kids with hardly any knowledge of game and team balance. They are crying over the stars we lost instead of focusing on the improvements we made. People with some basic sense and those who trust our management have good hope for this cycle.",7

1iq0k24,ipriyanshk20,It is plain disrespectful man,8
1iq0k24,ipriyanshk20,"One good thing that has happened to us after 2021 is INDIAN CORE

Samson was the only recognised Indian face during that phase man.

Now we have Samson Jaiswal Parag Nitish Jurel, even Vaibhav will join this list pretty soon.

Deshpande, Sandeep are also known and decent in IPL (Better than Sakariya, Ankit Rajpoot era😭😭)

Trusting the process 🧿",9
1iq0k24,ipriyanshk20,"I don’t even know when that stadium will be completed it was supposed to get done this year ffs. 

Leave that, RR management is spending money from their own pockets to increase the size of SMS this year just so that they can increase the capacity and dressing room area. RCA is such corrupt organisation. 

And it shouldn’t matter if the stadium is small or not if the rules say that we get playoff games then we should get it.

I totally agree with the Yashasvi statement, that boy will definitely bring glory to the state of Rajasthan 🧿🔥

And Indian core of Parag Jaiswal Jurel in the coming years and all of them peaking together is the sole point of this retentions. I don’t know why fans are not able to understand this and relate with what MI did in the past.

I know it hurts when legend like Jos or in past Watson left but it is what it is😓

We have batting depth this year which we lacked from the past 3 years. Thats where we lost so many games 😭😭

Also whoever chose to bat first in 2022 IPL finals should get dragged 😭😭 it still hurts",2
1iq0k24,ipriyanshk20,It shouldn’t be like that😓,2
1iq0k24,ipriyanshk20,It was about winning the title in last 3 years but yeah i understand you are a r3tard,4
1iq0k24,Connect-Barracuda-66,Naah no need this sub has understanding people.,10
1iq0k24,ipriyanshk20,Atleast you got to play season opener in previous years,7
1iq0k24,Beautiful-Speaker-60,But i still can’t believe we are betting on deshpande man like wtf😭😭,6
1iq0k24,Capable-Magician-418,"That bat first decision was such a cowardly move, i never want us to do that again.

Also, batting depth really was the reason we screwed up so many matches and i am glad RR looked for bowlers who can bat.",2
1iq0k24,Theashhking,"Ah yes I'm the ""r3tard"" when you attach the specific image of opening games played by teams and then go onto rant about it? What are you 9yrs old? Like how do u not understand why they haven't given rr opening games even after being in the finals or winning the competition it's because the fanbase isn't large enough to attract numbers, that is why we are hosting games at Guwahati to increase it and have a good enough fanbase by the time we reach next finals so that we also can get an opening day fixture, it's literally that simple they just want good teams to play opening day fixtures so that'll attract more viewership jeez i didn't know simple economics was so hard to understand and to answer your question no we are not gonna win a title with this team in 3 years heck we won't even reach semis with this team",-3
1iq0k24,Retro_Gamer12521,Fr i hope RR wins it this year so that they would have to make them play the first match.,8
1iq0k24,ipriyanshk20,"Bro jokes aside he is the highest wicket taker since last 2 IPLs 😭

Fans were saying the same when Avesh was traded in and he absolutely surprised everyone to the point that everyone was asking for him to get retained 🔥😁

Trust Shane Bond bro, Deshpande got some decent Hit the deck skills I am hopeful on him.",2
1iq0k24,ipriyanshk20,"I am new to reddit RR community man, but we dragged Sanga left right and centre on twitter for his stupid decisions in the last cycle.

Like he literally made some of the stupidest on field decisions that hurt us a lot.

Also buying fucking devdutt padikkal for 7.25 crore which costed us Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma - They were our main targets lol as shown in IPL auction prep video of 2022.

Sanga is a great great man manager but maybe not that great of a tactician. I love him tho",3
1iq0k24,ipriyanshk20,"Bruv i wrote scouting and player development because we are doing that alright 😭😭 and with the squad we had last cycle we should have won atleast 1 IPL

Why are you so pressed 😭",1

1ip2w4e,ScreenOtherwise7641,We even lost to mighty punjab in guwahati and couldn't play our next league match against kkr if we did and won that match we could be in q1 giving us 1 more chance hopefully that does not happen in this season,2
1ip2w4e,CartographerBrave259,"Bullshit. Guwahati games are ruining our home advantage. Any OG RR fan should know that SMS is our fortress. There were times when we could count on 5/7 wins from home games.

I wouldn't want RR to play in Guwahati even if the opposite team had prime Warne and Murali in their ranks",1
1ip2w4e,Theashhking,"Rr have the worst squad stop making imaginary scenarios as if we can win against these teams, so obviously finishing 10th with such poor squad planning",0
1ip2w4e,ipriyanshk20,They have better spinners lets be honest and why to give them that advantage tbh,4
1ip2w4e,ipriyanshk20,Cricbuzz,2
1ip2w4e,ipriyanshk20,"We scheduled our games earlier this season, before the monsoon arrives there.

We can still lose that it is a different topic but I think that the logic behind playing these 2 teams in guwahati can prove to be good.",5
1ip2w4e,ipriyanshk20,"You are right. Ideally all 7 games should be in SMS.
But if the team has decided to give 2 games in Guwahati then these 2 fixtures are the best possible ones. Thats all I am saying.",3
1ip2w4e,ipriyanshk20,Okay cry about it,1
1ip2w4e,Connect-Barracuda-66,"Imo for csk noor is great , ash anna's last season was a miss and imo he is not that great in T20 compared to his legacy in test and odi's, jadu is great but I still feel he can be hit or miss. Where as our team Theekshana was did really well for csk last season , hasaranga is doing his best in international t20 and odi and kumar k was really great in recent domestic leagues. Kkr is a different topic but I think we have better equal or just slightly better spin attack then csk.",4
1ip2w4e,Soggy_Ad_3686,Nope. I rate our spin attack above CSK and at par with KKR,3
1ip2w4e,Theashhking,I won't cause I'm well aware of the fact that a franchise with sangakkara and dravid at its helm can never succeed in ipl,0
1ip2w4e,ipriyanshk20,Fair point but still I think its a good move to play them away from SMS.,2
1ip2w4e,ipriyanshk20,"Fair enough.
So even if we are at par at them so it’s better to avoid them in SMS. We got cooked badly by GT in 2023 by Noor and Rashid.",1
1ip2w4e,ipriyanshk20,Ok😂,1
1ip2w4e,AshishNehra65,Sanga selected a very good squad last cycle,1
1ip2w4e,Theashhking,Sanga is a pussio of a coach he doesn't have the guts to take hard decisions and win titles he's just a decent option not someone you can achieve good enough success with,1
1ip2w4e,AshishNehra65,I agree! He bottled 2 IPL PLAYOFFS with a great bowling attack. The meltdown in 2023 was worse when RR were dominating ,1
1ip2w4e,Theashhking,"Finally somebody with sense everybody lives in delusion that he's so worldly coach when he's just straight up mediocre same for dravid, his success with India won't let me forget how shit of a coach he has been in ipl, the more I see likes of dravid, sangakkara coach the more I appreciate guys like Daniel vettori, Stephen Flemming their coaching is absolutely best of the best, they look to strengthen their core areas for the future while guys like sanga just ruin the team after 1 or 2 seasons",2
1ip2w4e,AshishNehra65,"What is your opinion about Tom Moody? I think Sanga's American accent fools a lot of local people as they feel he knows what he is doing! Sangakkara works at SKY SPORTS hence his unhealthy obsession with English players like TKC and Joe Root! Sanga did assembled a great bowling line-up as he learnt from Moody at Sunrisers and Punjab Kings! 


Dravid got those extra months with India as his original contract was over! He is great at getting local talent because he was at NCA! He set the foundations at Delhi where he got Sanju,Iyer and Pant! I feel there is great use for his talent id recognition but winning an IPL might nit be his strength!


Vettori is a clever operator as he knew that SRH had weak bowling so he went ultra-aggressive with the bat! His Lieutenant Pat Cummins believed in the strategy and backed his players which helped! Moreover he took a team which was BOTTOM in the previous season!He did a great TRADE of Shahbaz Ahmed with Sehwag's nephew which was a MASTERSTROKE! He went big on Aussie duo of Head and Cummins which transformed the team totally! Fleming has the gift of consistentcy where he picks the perfect players for Chepauk. He targets allrounders to get long batting lineups and multiple bowling options!",1
1ip2w4e,Theashhking,"Love moody to bits he's an amazing coach srh being a recognised team has a lot to do with tom moody, fans of rr are just emotional beings and nothing more, their cricket knowledge is rubbish atleast for 90% rr fans they think dravid and sanga can do something when they have absolutely ruined the very bowling unit that made rr good and now we arguably have the worst bowling unit in ipl, the middle order is absolutely shit and they are basically just banking on parag, Sanju and jaiswal to carry",1
1ip2w4e,AshishNehra65,"100% agreed regarding MOODY! He was the brains behind the BOWLING heavy strategy at SRH where they got 5 consecutive PLAYOFFS! Bayliss came in 2020 where he just kept what worked under Moody! He could have gone back to KKR but came to the stronger team! He lost control of harmonious dressing room in 2021 so much that Warner and Rashid Khan left as the environment was TOXIC!How did he FINISH BOTTOM in UAE when SRH had Nabi,Rashid and Mujeeb? Bayliss failed at Punjab Kings as well as Kumble gave him good foundations to build upon! Even in SRH sub some fans justify Kane Williamson being #1 RETENTION over Rashid Khan lol! Sanga got SL duo of Hasaranga and Theekshana. Theekshana is just economical for me! I prefer Mujeeb over him!Maphaka has potential but he is Expensive in in terms of economy! Archer is injury prone and doesn't seem as good as he was for RR in his 1st spell! Farooqi is excellent new ball operator but can get smashed in DEATH OVERS! Big Bund Deshpande is Expensive as well! Madhwal has the same problem but these 2 can get wickets so it is a double-edged sword. Also Dravid hopes that they bring WINNER spirit to RR as they have come from CSK and MI!Yudhvir Singh is not bad as I have seen him for LSG also he can give some lusty blows in the end! Interestingly only 2 allrounders in Hasaranga and Parag picked! RR always seem unbalanced to me and against allrounders as prefer specialists but limit the options this way! IMPACT SUB allows them to cover whatever they are doing in 2nd Innings usually! ",1

Dropping jaiswal after 1 match and then removing him from the squad is disrespectful and u guys are downplaying it but what about yashasvi and his family, how did they feel?",2
1iogwq7,ipriyanshk20,"Jaiswal was the preferred opener before the test season and same with Gill.
Samson and Abhishek were just there because the main players were busy in Red ball games.

They will be back when the focus shifts on T20I tournament. That is why this IPL is very important.

For ODIs, yes there is no place untill Rohit retires.",2
1iogwq7,Mental_Abalone_6857,"Ah yes drop the 2 players doing well internationally to accommodate 2 players who haven't played much international T20 lately, even if they do decent in ipl they shouldn't be replacing Abhishek and Samson",0

Remember he was the one who was a sure starter before the T20 WC but got benched because they wanted to open with Rohit and Kohli.

1-2 series won’t change anything, he will walk in mate unless he has a disastrous IPL.",2
1iogwq7,Mental_Abalone_6857,"He definitely didn't do anything wrong, amazing talent who has proven himself time and again up until now, I really believe and hope he is the future of Indian cricket BUT at this point in time I don't think he should be a walk in to the starting 11 when the team is more or less fixed, unless he has an unreal IPL season and one of top current 3 screw it up massively he shouldn't be a walk in, he can be the third option for opener and let form until next Wc decide who gets the playing 11 spot.

he has fixed his spot in Tests but he hasn't done so in the other formats YET",0
1iogwq7,ipriyanshk20,"Bro Abhishek was not even in squad for SL T20Is even after he scored a century in Zimbabwe.
He was removed from the opening spot once Jaiswal was back in Zim series.

Jaiswal is not someone who came to the squad after Abhishek and now has to wait lol. He was number 4 in T20I rankings before the test season. How quickly we forget things.

36 avg @ 164 SR but he has not done anything to cement his spot apparently. Lol sure.",2
1iogwq7,Mental_Abalone_6857,"Ya Zimbabwe series

Thankfully it's not about seniority in the cricket scene so much, no one is forgetting anything also because Babar Azam is no.1 in ODI's rn is he is he better than the likes of Smith especially with his antics in SL? 

 With the idea of getting a team set for the next wc you want your 15/16 to play as much together as possible with minimal experimentation, Abhishek and Samson are doing well at the top, having someone walk into the final 11 in their place will raise more questions than answer, Jaiswal should definitely be in the 15 and get chances in the 11 to figure out which chem of 2 out of 3 works best for the team but breaking something that isn't broken that's just dumb 

Also by your stats logic 33 avg @190+ SR means Abhishek has cemented his spot more than Jaiswal. Cementing the spot means there is no one who could possibly replace your position better than you, Abhishek/Samson got the chance and so far they've done well enough to fight for their spots",0

Hope all goes well 🧿",1
1iopffm,unadcunts,Fixtures haven't been officially released yet. What's the source?,1
1iopffm,Bunnyismm,"I can be wrong,  but this is the first time RR looking weak in compare to past few years",1
1iopffm,DesiNPC,"As an RR fan, it’s going to hurt a lot seeing Jos, Yuzi, Boult, Ashwin play for a different franchise.
So, I can understand 😭🥹",12
1iopffm,DesiNPC,The first few matches are confirmed. Check Cricbuzz,1
1iopffm,Erwin_Smith_FAN,Jos in GT would hurt like Nail in your toe ![img](emote|t5_37v43|51299),6
1iopffm,ashu-iiita,"
Maybe we can forget Yuzi, Boult, and Ashwin for once.
But Jos 🥹...
One of the greatest to ever play for RR",2
1iockvm,Batboix3107,Addition of Vikram Rathour is an icing on the cake the T20 World Cup winning batting coach and T 20 World Cup winning head coach,8
1iockvm,ishahahant,"You forgot to mention, dishant yagnik, rajamani, romi bhinder, and sid lehri",5
1iockvm,Ill-Map9464,i thought Sanga went yo KKR,2
1iockvm,ipriyanshk20,"Yeah the coaching setup looks better than last cycle’s.
Last cycle it was just Sanga doing everything- Head coach, batting and DOC",2
1iockvm,ipriyanshk20,"Rajamani is no more a part of RR also he wasn’t really part of the coaching staff.

Romi Bhinder is team manager.

Sid Lehri and Yagnik yeah but they are not that much relevant😭",-2
1iockvm,ipriyanshk20,Nah lol,2
1iockvm,ishahahant,"Bro lehri and yagnik are way too relevant, lehri is the person who takes care of the continuous assessment at the training centre, and also yagnik made the fielding of our team very strong. Their efforts are always ignored",6
1iockvm,ipriyanshk20,"I meant that during the season they don’t have that much of a role.

But off season yes Sid plays a big role in academies and also in SA20 and CPL.",0
1iockvm,Capable-Magician-418,"Off season's hard work is what is seen in the IPL, everyone of them is an important and integral part of RR.",1
1iockvm,ipriyanshk20,Not denying that obviously,1
