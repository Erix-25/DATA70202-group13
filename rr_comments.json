But I believe if our players are fit the we can perform like below.\n\nJofra 3 Overs in PP : 30 Runs and 1-2 Wickets\n\nSandeep 2 Overs in PP : 15 Runs and 1-2 Wickets\n\nTeekshna 1 Over in PP : 8 Runs and 0-1 Wickets\n\nSo Overall if we take 2-3 wickets in PP then no problem as latter Hasranga, Teekshna, Sandy, Madhwal will keep them under pressure and take wickets regularly then opposition can't score much. So final score will be like\n\nJofra 40/2, Sandeep 30/2, Hasranga 35/2, Teekshna 30/1, Madhwal 35/2, So Total = 170 and on most days we  should chase this.\n\nThe problem will come if we don't take wickets in PP, I hope that this case should be 2-3 match out of 14 only. Then\n\nJofra 50/1, Sandeep 35/2, Hasranga 35/1, Teekshna 35/1, Madhwal 45/2, So Total = 200 and worst case 215 if Sandeep, Hasranga, Teekshna all 3 also goes for 40 runs.\n\n\\- So These are the situation guys Hope so most of days we take wickets in PP then need to chase below 170-175.\n\nAnd only 2-3 matches in bad days we need to chase 200-220.\n\n>**I believe Our season will depend more on How our Batting Unit performs as our Top 4 are coming from Injuries Jaiswal, Sanju, Rana, Parag. If they perform consistently and one of Hetty/Dubey finishes well then we are good otherwise we are cooked**",
