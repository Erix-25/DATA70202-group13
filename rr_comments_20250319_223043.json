In Batting they are relying too much on foreign players like Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, David Miller, out of these only Pooran will be consistently successful on their home ground which favors spin. This team will really struggle on spinning pitches.\n\nI don't know RR will qualify or not but for LSG to qualify their top order should have a very outstanding season",

Hetmyer won us many lost matches as well so why are people so interested in letting him go? Our management had only 6 slots to retain and they made the choices which were best for rr, not for just this season but for the complete cycle and for the future of RR. Love buttler like every RR fan should do but stop bringing the team down being stuck in the past.",
